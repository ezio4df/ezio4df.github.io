		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>
			I started coding during school life — just playing with HTML and simple scripts because I thought it was
			magical that a computer could do something when I told it to. Back then, I had no plan, no guidance, and no
			idea where it would lead. I was completely aimless — just poking around, breaking things, copying code from
			forums, and trying to figure out why it worked (or didn't). That messy, self-driven exploration became my
			normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the years, I kept building things: small websites in PHP, interactive pages in JavaScript, and later full
			apps with React and Node.js. What fascinated me most wasn't just building things — it was taking them apart. I
			loved reverse engineering: reading others' code, understanding their logic, and often improving or repurposing
			it. That habit shaped how I learn. I've never formally studied languages like C, but if a codebase uses
			patterns similar to PHP or JavaScript, I can usually understand much of it — not by memorizing syntax, but by
			following the logic.
		</p>
		<p>
			When school got intense, I stepped back from building full-stack web apps — but I couldn't stay away from
			code. I turned to data mining, which felt like the next level of reverse engineering: figuring out how
			websites structure data, bypassing anti-bot measures, scraping intelligently, and turning messy HTML into
			clean, usable datasets. It was challenging, sometimes frustrating, but deeply satisfying — like solving a
			puzzle that kept changing. And unlike full projects, it was doable with just a little time each day.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then I found AI and machine learning. The first time I built a system using OpenCV, I let a user click and
			crop questions from a practice test image, then auto-saved and organized those crops for later review —
			effectively turning a static PDF into an interactive study tool. Around the same time, I watched reinforcement
			learning models (like those by YouTuber Yosh) learn to play games from scratch, slowly discovering strategies
			no human had taught them. Seeing an AI recognize patterns it had never seen before — and adapt — made
			everything click: this is what I've been circling my whole life. AI combines the interactivity I loved as a
			kid, the reverse-engineering mindset I developed over years, and the deep, open-ended challenge I've always
			craved.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hence, my goal now is clear: to push the limits of what AI can do — not just by using it, but by contributing
			to the research that shapes its future.
